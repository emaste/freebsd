    Now that tools/compat/compat_defs.h defones __USE, there's no
    need to treat the tools build as a special case.

    Stick ffs_ in front of the following macros:
       fragstoblks()
       blkstofrags()
       fragnum()
       blknum()
    
    to finish the job of distinguishing them from the lfs versions, which
    Christos renamed the other day.
    
    I believe this is the last of the overtly ambiguous exported symbols
    from ffs... or at least, the last of the ones that conflicted with lfs.
    ffs still pollutes the C namespace very broadly (as does ufs) and this
    needs quite a bit more cleanup.
    
    XXX: boo on macros with lowercase names. But I'm not tackling that just yet.

    Stick ffs_, ext2_, chfs_, filecore_, cd9660_, or mfs_ in front of
    the following symbols so as to disambiguate fully. (Christos already
    did the lfs ones.)
    
       lblkno
       lblktosize
       lfragtosize
       numfrags
       blkroundup

    dbtofsb() -> FFS_DBTOFSB() or EXT2_DBTOFSB()

    Rename ambiguous macros:
       MAXDIRSIZE -> UFS_MAXDIRSIZE or LFS_MAXDIRSIZE
       NINDIR -> FFS_NINDIR, EXT2_NINDIR, LFS_NINDIR, or MFS_NINDIR
       INOPB -> FFS_INOPB, LFS_INOPB
       INOPF -> FFS_INOPF, LFS_INOPF
       blksize -> ffs_blksize, ext2_blksize, or lfs_blksize
       sblksize -> ffs_blksize
    
    These are not the only ambiguously defined filesystem macros, of
    course, there's a pile more. I may not have found all the ambiguous
    definitions of blksize(), too, as there are a lot of other things
    called 'blksize' in the system.

      make it always fsinfo_t and change void * to that.

    buf is generic; it has nothing to do with ffs and will eventually be moved.

    - homogenize option parsing. more work for cd9660
    - use the new options parsing code to print an fs-specific usage

Author: bouyer <bouyer>
Date:   Sun Mar 6 17:08:10 2011 +0000

    merge the bouyer-quota2 branch. This adds a new on-disk format
    to store disk quota usage and limits, integrated with ffs
    metadata. Usage is checked by fsck_ffs (no more quotacheck)
    and is covered by the WAPBL journal. Enabled with kernel
    option QUOTA2 (added where QUOTA was enabled in kernel config files),
    turned on with tunefs(8) on a per-filesystem
    basis. mount_mfs(8) can also turn quotas on.
    
    See http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2011/02/19/msg010025.html
    for details.
