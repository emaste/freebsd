and/or ports.

NOTE TO PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT FreeBSD 15.x IS SLOW:
	FreeBSD 15.x has many debugging features turned on, in both the kernel
	and userland.  These features attempt to detect incorrect use of
	system primitives, and encourage loud failure through extra sanity
	checking and fail stop semantics.  They also substantially impact
	system performance.  If you want to do performance measurement,
	benchmarking, and optimization, you'll want to turn them off.  This
	includes various WITNESS- related kernel options, INVARIANTS, malloc
	debugging flags in userland, and various verbose features in the
	kernel.  Many developers choose to disable these features on build
	machines to maximize performance.  (To completely disable malloc
	debugging, define WITH_MALLOC_PRODUCTION in /etc/src.conf and rebuild
	world, or to merely disable the most expensive debugging functionality
	at runtime, run "ln -s 'abort:false,junk:false' /etc/malloc.conf".)

20240111:
	Commit cc760de2183f changed the internal interface between
	the nfscommon and nfscl modules.  As such, both need to be
	rebuilt from sources.  Therefore, __FreeBSD_version was
	bumped to 1500010.

20231120:
	If you have an arm64 system that uses ACPI, you will need to update your
	loader.efi in the ESP when you update past this point.  Detection of ACPI
	was moved earlier in the binary so the scripts could use it, but old
	binaries don't have this, so we default to 'no ACPI' in this case. You can
	undisable ACPI by doing
		OK unset hint.acpi.0.disabled
	This can also be used to recover any other system that was updated in the
	small window where amd64 was also broken.

20231113:
	The WITHOUT_LLD_IS_LD option has been removed.  When LLD is enabled
	it is always installed as /usr/bin/ld.

20231027:
	Forward compatibility (running the new code on old kernels) for the
	"ino64" project have been removed. The need for it has passed long ago.

20231018:
	Commit 57ce37f9dcd0 changed the internal KAPI between the
	nfscommon and nfscl modules.  Both must be rebuilt from sources.

20231010:
	dialog(1) has been replaced in base by bsddialog(1), while most of the
	time replacing a dialog(1) call by a bsddialog(1) call works out of the
	box, bsddialog(1) is not considered as a drop-in replacement for
	dialog(1).

	If you do depend on dialog(1) functionality, please install cdialog
	from ports:

	pkg install cdialog

20230927:
	The EARLY_AP_STARTUP kernel option is mandatory on x86.  The option
	has been added to DEFAULTS, so it should automatically be included in
	custom kernel configurations without any additional change.

20230922:
	A new loader tunable net.pf.default_to_drop allows pf(4)â€™s default
	behaviour to be changed from pass to drop. Previously this required
	recompiling the kernel with the option PF_DEFAULT_TO_DROP.

20230914:
	Enable splitting out pkgbase manpages into separate packages by
	default. To disable this, set WITHOUT_MANSPLITPKG=yes in src.conf.

20230911:
	Move standard include files to the clibs-dev package and move clang
	internal libraries and headers to clang and clang-dev. Upgrading systems
	installed using pkgbase past this change involves extra steps to allow
	for these file moves:

		pkg upgrade -y FreeBSD-utilities
		pkg upgrade -y FreeBSD-utilities-dev
		pkg upgrade -y

20230909:
	Enable vnet sysctl variables to be loader tunable. SYSCTLs which
	belongs to VNETs can be initialized during early boot or module
	loading if they are marked with CTLFLAG_TUN and there are
	corresponding kernel environment variables.

20230901:
	The WITH_INIT_ALL_PATTERN and WITH_INIT_ALL_ZERO build options have
	been replaced by INIT_ALL=pattern and INIT_ALL=zero respectively.

20230824:
	FreeBSD 15.0-CURRENT.

20230817:
	Serial communication (in boot loaders, kernel, and userland) has
	been changed to default to 115200 bps, in line with common industry
	practice and typcial firmware serial console redirection
	configuration.

	Note that the early x86 BIOS bootloader (i.e., boot0sio) does not
	support rates above 9600 bps and is not changed. boot0sio users may
	set BOOT_COMCONSOLE_SPEED=9600 to use 9600 for all of the boot
	components, or use the standard boot0 and have the boot2 stage start
	with the serial port at 115200.

20230807:
	Following the general removal of MIPS support, the ath(4) AHB bus-
	frontend has been removed, too, and building of the PCI support is
	integrated with the ath(4) main module again. As a result, there's
	no longer a need for if_ath_pci_load="YES" in /boot/loader.conf or
	"device ath_pci" in the kernel configuration.

20230803:
	MAXCPU has been increased to 1024 in the amd64 GENERIC kernel config.
	Out-of-tree kernel modules will need to be rebuilt.

20230724:
	CAM has been mechanically updated s/u_int(64|32|16|8)_t/uint\1_t/g
	to move to the standard uintXX_t types from the old, traditional
	BSD u_intXX_t types. This should be a NOP, but may cause problems
	for out of tree changes. The SIMs were not updated since most of
	the old u_intXX_t uses weren't due to CAM interfaces.

20230713:
	stable/14 branch created.

20230629:
	The heuristic for detecting old chromebooks with an EC bug that requires
	atkbdc driver workarounds has changed. There should be no functional
	change, but if your old chromebook's keyboard stops working, please
	file a PR and assign it to imp.

20230623:
	OpenSSL has been updated to version 3.0, including changes throughout
	the base system.  It is important to rebuild third-party software
	after upgrading.

20230619:
	To enable pf rdr rules for connections initiated from the host, pf
	filter rules can be optionally enabled for packets delivered
	locally. This can change the behavior of rules which match packets
	delivered to lo0. To enable this feature:

		sysctl net.pf.filter_local=1
		service pf restart

	When enabled, its best to ensure that packets delivered locally are not
	filtered, e.g. by adding a 'skip on lo' rule.

20230613:
	Improvements to libtacplus(8) mean that tacplus.conf(5) now
	follows POSIX shell syntax rules. This may cause TACACS+
	authentication to fail if the shared secret contains a single
	quote, double quote, or backslash character which isn't
	already properly quoted or escaped.

20230612:
	Belatedly switch the default nvme block device on x86 from nvd to nda.
	nda created nvd compatibility links by default, so this should be a
	nop. If this causes problems for your application, set hw.nvme.use_nvd=1
	in your loader.conf or add `options NVME_USE_NVD=1` to your kernel
	config. To disable the nvd compatibility aliases, add
	kern.cam.nda.nvd_compat=0 to loader.conf.  The default has been nda on
	all non-x86 platforms for some time now. If you need to fall back,
	please email imp@freebsd.org about why.

	Encrypted swap partitions need to be changed from nvd to nda if you
	migrate, or you need to use the above to switch back to nvd.

20230422:
	Remove portsnap(8).  Users are encouraged to obtain the ports tree
	using git instead.

20230420:
	Add jobs.mk to save typing. Enables -j${JOB_MAX} and logging
	eg.
		make buildworld-jobs
	runs
		make -j${JOB_MAX} buildworld > ../buildworld.log 2>&1

	where JOB_MAX is derrived from ncpus in local.sys.mk if not set in env.

20230316:
	Video related devices for some arm devices have been renamed.
	If you have a custom kernel config and want to use hdmi output on
	IMX6 board you need to add "device dwc_hdmi" "device imx6_hdmi" and
	"device imx6_ipu" to it.
	If you have a custom kernel config and want to use hdmi output on
	TI AM335X board you need to add "device tda19988" to it.
	If you add "device hdmi" in it you need to remove it as it doesn't
	exist anymore.

20230221:
	Introduce new kernel options KBD_DELAY1 and KBD_DELAY2. See atkbdc(4)
	for details.

20230206:
	sshd now defaults to having X11Forwarding disabled, following upstream.
	Administrators who wish to enable X11Forwarding should add
	`X11Forwarding yes` to /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

20230204:
	Since commit 75d41cb6967 Huawei 3G/4G LTE Mobile Devices do not default
	to ECM, but NCM mode and need u3g and ucom modules loaded. See cdce(4).

20230130:
	As of commit 7c40e2d5f685, the dependency on netlink(4) has been added
	to the linux_common(4) module. Users relying on linux_common may need
	to complile netlink(4) module if it is not present in their kernel.

20230126:
	The WITHOUT_CXX option has been removed. C++ components in the base
	system are now built unconditionally.

20230113:
	LinuxKPI pci.h changes may require out-of-tree drivers to be recompiled.
	Bump _FreeBSD_version to 1400078 to be able to detect this change.

20221212:
	llvm-objump is now always installed as objdump.  Previously there was
	no /usr/bin/objdump unless the WITH_LLVM_BINUTILS knob was used.

	Some LLVM objdump options have a different output format compared to
	GNU objdump; readelf is available for inspecting ELF files, and GNU
	objdump is available from the devel/binutils port or package.

20221205:
	dma(8) has replaced sendmail(8) as the default mta.  For people willing
	to reenable sendmail(8):

	$ cp /usr/share/examples/sendmail/mailer.conf /etc/mail/mailer.conf

	and add sendmail_enable="YES" to rc.conf.

20221204:
	hw.bus.disable_failed_devices has changed from 'false' to 'true' by
	default. Now if newbus succeeds in probing a device, but fails to attach
	the device, we'll disable the device. In the past, we'd keep retrying
	the device on each new driver loaded. To get that behavior now, one
	needs to use devctl to re-enable the device, and reprobe it (or set
	the sysctl/tunable hw.bus.disable_failed_devices=false).

	NOTE: This was reverted 20221205 due to unexpected compatibility issues

20221122:
	pf no longer accepts 'scrub fragment crop' or 'scrub fragment drop-ovl'.
	These configurations are no longer automatically reinterpreted as
	'scrub fragment reassemble'.

20221121:
	The WITHOUT_CLANG_IS_CC option has been removed.  When Clang is enabled
	it is always installed as /usr/bin/cc (and c++, cpp).

20221026:
	Some programs have been moved into separate packages. It is recommended
	for pkgbase users to do:

	pkg install FreeBSD-dhclient FreeBSD-geom FreeBSD-resolvconf \
	  FreeBSD-devd FreeBSD-devmatch

	after upgrading to restore all the component that were previously
	installed.

20221002:
	OPIE has been removed from the base system.  If needed, it can
	be installed from ports (security/opie) or packages (opie).
	Otherwise, make sure that your PAM policies do not reference
	pam_opie or pam_opieaccess.

20220610:
	LinuxKPI pm.h changes require an update to the latest drm-kmod version
	before re-compiling to avoid errors.

20211230:
	The macros provided for the manipulation of CPU sets (e.g. CPU_AND)
	have been modified to take 2 source arguments instead of only 1.
	Externally maintained sources that use these macros will have to
	be adapted. The FreeBSD version has been bumped to 1400046 to
	reflect this change.

20211214:
	A number of the kernel include files are able to be included by
	themselves.  A test has been added to buildworld to enforce this.

20211209:
	Remove mips as a recognized target. This starts the decommissioning of
	mips support in FreeBSD. mips related items will be removed wholesale in
	the coming days and weeks.

	This broke the NO_CLEAN build for some people. Either do a clean build
	or touch
		lib/clang/include/llvm/Config/Targets.def
		lib/clang/include/llvm/Config/AsmParsers.def
		lib/clang/include/llvm/Config/Disassemblers.def
		lib/clang/include/llvm/Config/AsmPrinters.def
	before the build to force everything to rebuild that needs to.

20211202:
	Unbound support for RFC8375: The special-use domain 'home.arpa' is
	by default blocked. To unblock it use a local-zone nodefault
	statement in unbound.conf:
		local-zone: "home.arpa." nodefault

	Or use another type of local-zone to override with your choice.

	The reason for this is discussed in Section 6.1 of RFC8375:
	Because 'home.arpa.' is not globally scoped and cannot be secured
	using DNSSEC based on the root domain's trust anchor, there is no way
	to tell, using a standard DNS query, in which homenet scope an answer
	belongs.  Consequently, users may experience surprising results with
	such names when roaming to different homenets.

20211110:
	Commit b8d60729deef changed the TCP congestion control framework so
	that any of the included congestion control modules could be
	the single module built into the kernel. Previously newreno
	was automatically built in through direct reference. As of
	this commit you are required to declare at least one congestion
	control module (e.g. 'options CC_NEWRENO') and to also declare a
	default using the CC_DEFAULT option (e.g. options CC_DEFAULT="newreno\").
	The GENERIC configuration includes CC_NEWRENO and defines newreno
	as the default. If no congestion control option is built into the
	kernel and you are including networking, the kernel compile will
	fail. Also if no default is declared the kernel compile will fail.

20211118:
	Mips has been removed from universe builds. It will be removed from the
	tree shortly.

20211106:
	Commit f0c9847a6c47 changed the arguments for VOP_ALLOCATE.
	The NFS modules must be rebuilt from sources and any out
	of tree file systems that implement their own VOP_ALLOCATE
	may need to be modified.

20211022:
	The synchronous PPP kernel driver sppp(4) has been removed.
	The cp(4) and ce(4) drivers are now always compiled with netgraph(4)
	support, formerly enabled by NETGRAPH_CRONYX option.

20211020:
	sh(1) is now the default shell for the root user.  To force root to use
	the csh shell, please run the following command as root:

	# chsh -s csh

20211004:
	Ncurses distribution has been split between libtinfow and libncurses
	with libncurses.so becoming a linker (ld) script to seamlessly link
	to libtinfow as needed. Bump _FreeBSD_version to 1400035 to reflect
	this change.

20210923:
	As of commit 8160a0f62be6, the dummynet module no longer depends on the
	ipfw module. Dummynet can now be used by pf as well as ipfw. As such
	users who relied on this dependency may need to include ipfw in the
	list of modules to load on their systems.

20210922:
	As of commit 903873ce1560, the mixer(8) utility has got a slightly
	new syntax. Please refer to the mixer(8) manual page for more
	information. The old mixer utility can be installed from ports:
	audio/freebsd-13-mixer

20210911:
	As of commit 55089ef4f8bb, the global variable nfs_maxcopyrange has
	been deleted from the nfscommon.ko.  As such, nfsd.ko must be built
	from up to date sources to avoid an undefined reference when
	being loaded.

20210817:
	As of commit 62ca9fc1ad56 OpenSSL no longer enables kernel TLS
	by default.  Users can enable kernel TLS via the "KTLS" SSL
	option.  This can be enabled globally by using a custom
	OpenSSL config file via OPENSSL_CONF or via an
	application-specific configuration option for applications
	which permit setting SSL options via SSL_CONF_cmd(3).

20210811:
	Commit 3ad1e1c1ce20 changed the internal KAPI between the NFS
	modules. Therefore, all need to be rebuilt from sources.

20210730:
	Commit b69019c14cd8 removes pf's DIOCGETSTATESNV ioctl.
	As of be70c7a50d32 it is no longer used by userspace, but it does mean
	users may not be able to enumerate pf states if they update the kernel
	past b69019c14cd8 without first updating userspace past be70c7a50d32.

20210729:
	As of commit 01ad0c007964 if_bridge member interfaces can no longer
	change their MTU. Changing the MTU of the bridge itself will change the
	MTU on all member interfaces instead.

20210716:
	Commit ee29e6f31111 changed the internal KAPI between the nfscommon
	and nfsd modules. Therefore, both need to be rebuilt from sources.
	Bump __FreeBSD_version to 1400026 for this KAPI change.

20210715:
	The 20210707 awk update brought in a change in behavior. This has
	been corrected as of d4d252c49976. Between these dates, if you
	installed a new awk binary, you may not be able to build a new
	kernel because the change in behavior affected the genoffset
	script used to build the kernel. If you did update, the fix is
	to update your sources past the above hash and do
		% cd usr.bin/awk
		% make clean all
		% sudo -E make install
	to enable building kernels again.

20210708:
	Commit 1e0a518d6548 changed the internal KAPI between the NFS
	modules. They all need to be rebuilt from sources.  I did not
	bump __FreeBSD_version, since it was bumped recently.

20210707:
	awk has been updated to the latest one-true-awk version 20210215.
	This contains a number of minor bug fixes.

20210624:
	The NFSv4 client now uses the highest minor version of NFSv4
	supported by the NFSv4 server by default instead of minor version 0,
	for NFSv4 mounts.
	The "minorversion" mount option may be used to override this default.

20210618:
	Bump __FreeBSD_version to 1400024 for LinuxKPI changes.
	Most notably netdev.h can change now as the (last) dependencies
	(mlx4/ofed) are now using struct ifnet directly, but also for PCI
	additions and others.

20210618:
	The directory "blacklisted" under /usr/share/certs/ has been
	renamed to "untrusted".

20210611:
	svnlite has been removed from base. Should you need svn for any reason
	please install the svn package or port.

20210611:
	Commit e1a907a25cfa changed the internal KAPI between the krpc
	and nfsserver.  As such, both modules must be rebuilt from
	sources.  Bump __FreeBSD_version to 1400022.

20210610:
	The an(4) driver has been removed from FreeBSD.

20210608:
	The vendor/openzfs branch was renamed to vendor/openzfs/legacy to
	start tracking OpenZFS upstream more closely. Please see
https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-current/2021-June/000153.html
	for details on how to correct any errors that might result. The
	short version is that you need to remove the old branch locally:
	    git update-ref -d refs/remotes/freebsd/vendor/openzfs
	(assuming your upstream origin is named 'freebsd').

20210525:
	Commits 17accc08ae15 and de102f870501 add new files to LinuxKPI
	which break drm-kmod.  In addition various other additions where
	committed. Bump __FreeBSD_version to 1400015 to be able to
	detect this.

20210513:
	Commit ca179c4d74f2 changed the package in which the OpenSSL
	libraries and utilities are packaged.
	It is recommended for pkgbase user to do:
	pkg install -f FreeBSD-openssl
	before pkg upgrade otherwise some dependencies might not be met
	and pkg will stop working as libssl will not be present anymore
	on the system.

20210426:
	Commit 875977314881 changed the internal KAPI between
	the nfsd and nfscommon modules.  As such these modules
	need to be rebuilt from sources.
	Without this patch in your NFSv4.1/4.2 server, enabling
	delegations by setting vfs.nfsd.issue_delegations non-zero
	is not recommended.

20210411:
	Commit 7763814fc9c2 changed the internal KAPI between
	the krpc and NFS.  As such, the krpc, nfscommon and
	nfscl modules must all be rebuilt from sources.
	Without this patch, NFSv4.1/4.2 mounts should not
	be done with the nfscbd(8) daemon running, to avoid
	needing a working back channel for server->client RPCs.

20210330:
	Commit 01ae8969a9ee fixed the NFSv4.1/4.2 server so that it
	handles binding of the back channel as required by RFC5661.
	Until this patch is in your server, avoid use of the "nconnects"
	mount option for Linux NFSv4.1/4.2 mounts.

20210225:
	For 64-bit architectures the base system is now built with Position
	Independent Executable (PIE) support enabled by default.  It may be
	disabled using the WITHOUT_PIE knob.  A clean build is required.

20210128:
	Various LinuxKPI functionality was added which conflicts with DRM.
	Please update your drm-kmod port to after the __FreeBSD_version 1400003
	update.

20210121:
	stable/13 branch created.

20210108:
	PC Card attachments for all devices have been removed. In the case of
	wi and cmx, the entire drivers were removed because they were only
	PC Card devices. FreeBSD_version 1300134 should be used for this
	since it was bumped so recently.

20210107:
	Transport-independent parts of HID support have been split off the USB
	code in to separate subsystem.  Kernel configs which include one of
	ums, ukbd, uhid, atp, wsp, wmt, uaudio, ugold or ucycom drivers should
	be updated with adding of "device hid" line.

20210105:
	ncurses installation has been modified to only keep the widechar
	enabled version.  Incremental build is broken for that change, so it
	requires a clean build.

20201223:
	The FreeBSD project has migrated from Subversion to Git. Temporary
	instructions can be found at
	https://github.com/bsdimp/freebsd-git-docs/blob/main/src-cvt.md
	and other documents in that repo.


20181019:
	Stable/12 was branched created.

20170619:
	Forward compatibility for the "ino64" project have been committed. This
	will allow most new binaries to run on older kernels in a limited
	fashion.  This prevents many of the common foot-shooting actions in the
	upgrade as well as the limited ability to roll back the kernel across
	the ino64 upgrade. Complicated use cases may not work properly, though
	enough simpler ones work to allow recovery in most situations.
After branch N is created, entries older than the N-2 branch point are removed
from this file. After stable/14 is branched and current becomes FreeBSD 15,
entries older than stable/12 branch point will be removed from current's
UPDATING file.

COMMON ITEMS:

	General Notes
	-------------
	Sometimes, obscure build problems are the result of environment
	poisoning.  This can happen because the make utility reads its
	environment when searching for values for global variables.  To run
	your build attempts in an "environmental clean room", prefix all make
	commands with 'env -i '.  See the env(1) manual page for more details.
	Occasionally a build failure will occur with "make -j" due to a race
	condition.  If this happens try building again without -j, and please
	report a bug if it happens consistently.

	When upgrading from one major version to another it is generally best to
	upgrade to the latest code in the currently installed branch first, then
	do an upgrade to the new branch. This is the best-tested upgrade path,
	and has the highest probability of being successful.  Please try this
	approach if you encounter problems with a major version upgrade.  Since
	the stable 4.x branch point, one has generally been able to upgrade from
	anywhere in the most recent stable branch to head / current (or even the
	last couple of stable branches). See the top of this file when there's
	an exception.

	The update process will emit an error on an attempt to perform a build
	or install from a FreeBSD version below the earliest supported version.
	When updating from an older version the update should be performed one
	major release at a time, including running `make delete-old` at each
	step.

	When upgrading a live system, having a root shell around before
	installing anything can help undo problems. Not having a root shell
	around can lead to problems if pam has changed too much from your
	starting point to allow continued authentication after the upgrade.

	This file should be read as a log of events. When a later event changes
	information of a prior event, the prior event should not be deleted.
	Instead, a pointer to the entry with the new information should be
	placed in the old entry. Readers of this file should also sanity check
	older entries before relying on them blindly. Authors of new entries
	should write them with this in mind.

	ZFS notes
	---------
	When upgrading the boot ZFS pool to a new version (via zpool upgrade),
	always follow these three steps:

	1) recompile and reinstall the ZFS boot loader and boot block
	(this is part of "make buildworld" and "make installworld")

	2) update the ZFS boot block on your boot drive (only required when
	doing a zpool upgrade):

	When booting on x86 via BIOS, use the following to update the ZFS boot
	block on the freebsd-boot partition of a GPT partitioned drive ada0:
		gpart bootcode -p /boot/gptzfsboot -i $N ada0
	The value $N will typically be 1.  For EFI booting, see EFI notes.

	3) zpool upgrade the root pool. New bootblocks will work with old
	pools, but not vice versa, so they need to be updated before any
	zpool upgrade.

	Non-boot pools do not need these updates.

	EFI notes
	---------

	There are two locations the boot loader can be installed into. The
	current location (and the default) is \efi\freebsd\loader.efi and using
	efibootmgr(8) to configure it. The old location, that must be used on
	deficient systems that don't honor efibootmgr(8) protocols, is the
	fallback location of \EFI\BOOT\BOOTxxx.EFI. Generally, you will copy
	/boot/loader.efi to this location, but on systems installed a long time
	ago the ESP may be too small and /boot/boot1.efi may be needed unless
	the ESP has been expanded in the meantime.

	Recent systems will have the ESP mounted on /boot/efi, but older ones
	may not have it mounted at all, or mounted in a different
	location. Older arm SD images with MBR used /boot/msdos as the
	mountpoint. The ESP is a MSDOS filesystem.

	The EFI boot loader rarely needs to be updated. For ZFS booting,
	however, you must update loader.efi before you do 'zpool upgrade' the
	root zpool, otherwise the old loader.efi may reject the upgraded zpool
	since it does not automatically understand some new features.

	See loader.efi(8) and uefi(8) for more details.

	To build a kernel
	-----------------
	If you are updating from a prior version of FreeBSD (even one just
	a few days old), you should follow this procedure.  It is the most
	failsafe as it uses a /usr/obj tree with a fresh mini-buildworld,

	make kernel-toolchain
	make -DALWAYS_CHECK_MAKE buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	make -DALWAYS_CHECK_MAKE installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE

	To test a kernel once
	---------------------
	If you just want to boot a kernel once (because you are not sure
	if it works, or if you want to boot a known bad kernel to provide
	debugging information) run
	make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE KODIR=/boot/testkernel
	nextboot -k testkernel

	To rebuild everything and install it on the current system.
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	# Note: sometimes if you are running current you gotta do more than
	# is listed here if you are upgrading from a really old current.

	<make sure you have good level 0 dumps>
	make buildworld
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
							[1]
	<reboot in single user>				[3]
	etcupdate -p					[5]
	make installworld
	etcupdate -B					[4]
	make delete-old					[6]
	<reboot>

	To cross-install current onto a separate partition
	--------------------------------------------------
	# In this approach we use a separate partition to hold
	# current's root, 'usr', and 'var' directories.   A partition
	# holding "/", "/usr" and "/var" should be about 2GB in
	# size.

	<make sure you have good level 0 dumps>
	<boot into -stable>
	make buildworld
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	<maybe newfs current's root partition>
	<mount current's root partition on directory ${CURRENT_ROOT}>
	make installworld DESTDIR=${CURRENT_ROOT} -DDB_FROM_SRC
	make distribution DESTDIR=${CURRENT_ROOT} # if newfs'd
	make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE DESTDIR=${CURRENT_ROOT}
	cp /etc/fstab ${CURRENT_ROOT}/etc/fstab 		   # if newfs'd
	<edit ${CURRENT_ROOT}/etc/fstab to mount "/" from the correct partition>
	<reboot into current>
	<do a "native" rebuild/install as described in the previous section>
	<maybe install compatibility libraries from ports/misc/compat*>
	<reboot>


	To upgrade in-place from stable to current
	----------------------------------------------
	<make sure you have good level 0 dumps>
	make buildworld					[9]
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE	[8]
	make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
							[1]
	<reboot in single user>				[3]
	etcupdate -p					[5]
	make installworld
	etcupdate -B					[4]
	make delete-old					[6]
	<reboot>

	Make sure that you've read the UPDATING file to understand the
	tweaks to various things you need.  At this point in the life
	cycle of current, things change often and you are on your own
	to cope.  The defaults can also change, so please read ALL of
	the UPDATING entries.

	Also, if you are tracking -current, you must be subscribed to
	freebsd-current@freebsd.org.  Make sure that before you update
	your sources that you have read and understood all the recent
	messages there.  If in doubt, please track -stable which has
	much fewer pitfalls.

	[1] If you have third party modules, such as vmware, you should disable
	them at this point so they don't crash your system on
	reboot. Alternatively, you should rebuild all the modules you have in
	your system and install them as well.  If you are running -current, you
	should seriously consider placing all sources to all the modules for
	your system (or symlinks to them) in /usr/local/sys/modules so this
	happens automatically. If all your modules come from ports, then adding
	the port origin directories to PORTS_MODULES instead is also automatic
	and effective, eg:
	     PORTS_MODULES+=x11/nvidia-driver

	[3] From the bootblocks, boot -s, and then do
		fsck -p
		mount -u /
		mount -a
		sh /etc/rc.d/zfs start	# mount zfs filesystem, if needed
		cd src			# full path to source
		adjkerntz -i		# if CMOS is wall time
	Also, when doing a major release upgrade, it is required that you boot
	into single user mode to do the installworld.

	[4] Note: This step is non-optional.  Failure to do this step
	can result in a significant reduction in the functionality of the
	system.  Attempting to do it by hand is not recommended and those
	that pursue this avenue should read this file carefully, as well
	as the archives of freebsd-current and freebsd-hackers mailing lists
	for potential gotchas.  See etcupdate(8) for more information.

	[5] Usually this step is a no-op.  However, from time to time
	you may need to do this if you get unknown user in the following
	step.

	[6] This only deletes old files and directories. Old libraries
	can be deleted by "make delete-old-libs", but you have to make
	sure that no program is using those libraries anymore.

	[8] The new kernel must be able to run existing binaries used by an
	installworld.  When upgrading across major versions, the new kernel's
	configuration must include the correct COMPAT_FREEBSD<n> option for
	existing binaries (e.g. COMPAT_FREEBSD11 to run 11.x binaries).  Failure
	to do so may leave you with a system that is hard to boot to recover. A
	GENERIC kernel will include suitable compatibility options to run
	binaries from older branches.  Note that the ability to run binaries
	from unsupported branches is not guaranteed.

	Make sure that you merge any new devices from GENERIC since the
	last time you updated your kernel config file. Options also
	change over time, so you may need to adjust your custom kernels
	for these as well.

	[9] If CPUTYPE is defined in your /etc/make.conf, make sure to use the
	"?=" instead of the "=" assignment operator, so that buildworld can
	override the CPUTYPE if it needs to.

	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX must be defined in an environment variable, and
	not on the command line, or in /etc/make.conf.  buildworld will
	warn if it is improperly defined.
FORMAT:

This file contains a list, in reverse chronological order, of major
breakages in tracking -current.  It is not guaranteed to be a complete
list of such breakages, and only contains entries since September 23, 2011.
If you need to see UPDATING entries from before that date, you will need
to fetch an UPDATING file from an older FreeBSD release.
